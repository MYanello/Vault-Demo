Demonstrate HashiCorp Vault functionality through a series of hands-on demos.

To run, you'll need Python, [k3d](https://k3d.io/stable/#releases) and [vault cli](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/get-started/install-binary) installed.

To start, run the `setup-env.sh` and `setup-metallb.sh` scripts to get a basic k8s cluster and loadbalancer up.  
Then you can step through the Labs and their individual READMEs.
